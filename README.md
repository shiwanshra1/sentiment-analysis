# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
The sentiment analysis project aims to analyze user reviews from an online platform and classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
Through a systematic methodology encompassing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and visualization, valuable insights are derived from the dataset.

## Key Findings and Conclusions

### Data Preprocessing
- The dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis by handling missing values, merging relevant columns, converting text to lowercase, removing noise (e.g., punctuation, URLs), and applying tokenization, stopwords removal, and stemming.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- EDA revealed insights into the distribution of sentiments, helpfulness rates, and other features. Visualization techniques such as histograms, bar plots, and word clouds provided a deeper understanding of the dataset.

### Feature Engineering
- New features such as review length, word count, polarity scores, and TF-IDF vectorized representations were generated to capture meaningful information from the reviews.

### Model Building and Evaluation
- Several machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated on the preprocessed data to classify sentiments. Models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score. Ensemble methods like random forests and gradient boosting exhibited promising performance.

### Visualization
- Visualizations such as ROC curves, confusion matrices, and word clouds enhanced the interpretability of results and provided insights into model performance and feature importance.

### Insights and Recommendations
- Positive reviews tended to have higher helpfulness rates, indicating a correlation between sentiment and user engagement. Seasonal trends in reviews, as well as product-specific sentiments, were identified through EDA. Recommendations were made for businesses to leverage sentiment analysis insights for improving products, customer satisfaction, and decision-making.
